i will probably end it when my mum is n't around anymore i can say with certainty that i have tried hard to make my life one worth living but my ongoing depression is more present and crippling than ever recently i would never do anything while my mum is still alive because i know she would n't cope i'm her only daughter and we are very close but i'm clueless as to how to live with this fog that has followed me since my teenage years , especially if i do n't have her in my life it 's as if the depression becomes heavier the older i get , despite the sertraline and hours and hours of therapy i just ca n't see myself living a long and fulfilled lif

i need therapy but i'm too scared to ask for it i want to tell my parents i need therapy and how depressed i am , but they 'd just say i have it better than so many people and that i'm lazy that 's the response i get any time i mention something about my mental health also , if i tell my school , they 'd notify my parents and it would be an absolute shitstorm if they found out that i did n't tell them first i'm so hopeless and i do n't know what to do at this point what should i do \?
i don t think i m gonna make it through 2020 i already spent a lot of my time at work today thinking about how hopeless my life is and how much easier things would be if i just ended it i barely scraped through 2019 , the thought of another year is terrifying i m so ti
after two good new years , this one is the worst after finally going through new year with friends last two years , this year they finally betrayed and excluded me from their group by spreading false rumors about me now i'm alone at home while i watch their comments and pictures about what they 're doing god , i 've never felt so empty and hurting , my chest hurts so much it 's almost umbearable , and i never thought about killing myself that much
why do you and , people i love pick people who treat us like nothing \( we accept the love we think we deserve \) you know when you re with someone and things are just not right but , you re afraid to ask because the answer might be worse then the feeling right now i think i m the only person who has destined to care so much about one person it nearly kills me how do people go on when they lose someone they love so much \? i don t understand how people wake up and keep moving on but you do wake up and for just a sec you forget then , ohh you remember it s like hearing there last i love you for one last time again and again every time how do you keep going when the worst things happen \?

getting back to normal life i 've been getting treatment for a couple months now and finally feel like my life is back on track with a successful medication regamine and therapy however i kinda fell off the face of the planet while things were going wrong and feel that ive lost a lot of friends because of it i do feel bad for being generally unavailable or a bit flaky , but it 's hard to think about the fact that i 've sort of lost my old life before i got sick has anyone had a similar experience or advice on how they moved on after getting their depression under control \?
last day of 2019 i ll be honest i had high hopes for today my family and i were all gonna sit in the living room watching friends but not just watching , laughing and talking together as well but now it s the last two hours of the year and my parents are watching something else , my brother is playing video games and i m stuck in the basement feeling sorry for myself the last hours and i m depressed i m going to start the new year depressed sometimes i hate that i have hope it somehow hurts me more once it s 12 00 i m gonna go to bed , listen to music while staring up at the ceiling just letting depression take over , like usual
changed my life for the better , still miserable this year , not only did i finally get my ged , after wasting 5 years of my life doing nothing , i lost weight , got myself my first job , put my self out there , started socializing more , had sex , and some how i still feel utterly alone , tierd , depressed and all around miserable wasted 5 years , and in those 5 years i stopped feeling bad , but then again i was literally doing nothing now that i'm getting my life together somewhat , it feels like i'm opening a wound that will never heal and just feeling all the pain again
2020 is in less than 2 hours and i do n't feel ready everything is against me , especially during these holidays my friends , my family , myself are all fucking me up deeply 2019 was not a good year for me how am i supposed to survive 2020 when theres no one left to help me \?
dae cry on new years or their birthday for the past couple of years i always cry on new years and my birthday i think it s because it reminds me how another has gone by but i m still miserable i m trying so hard not to cry this year but it s so ha
i hate myself so much that i ve thought about ending it all , but a small voice in my head tells me that there s a chance things might get better i hate living , but i also don t want to die incase things get better for me my life sucks and it s been that way for a while , but a small part of me has hope that it won t always be this way i just hope i figure it out and get myself out of this i hate being feeling this way i wish i knew what to do i wish i had an answer to get out of this i m lost and hopeless no hates me more than i do myself

alone on nye \( another holiday \) again i'm so tired of being alone all the time i'm trying to be a good person , meet peoole , do things and just like my 30th birthday earlier this past year i'm alone again i 've reached out to people and been ghosted i 've asked and been told one thing and then they disappear i 've asked on facebook , i 've looked online and that 's it just another nye alone by myself without a single fuck from anyone it 's hard enough dealing with depression and not using as it is but right now i just want to give up what 's the point of life if you 're never living
who here went to a nye party and still feels like shit \? went to a party invited by friends , absolutely packed , and it was awful despite all the drugs , alcohol , people trying to engage me , i lost i could n't enjoy myself , i hated being there , i wish i spent nye at home rather than spend it with a whole load of people who \( to no fault of their own \) make me feel alone i feel like i let myself and my friends down by not being anything to everyone who spent nye alone and feels awful , just know that the quote it is better to be alone than to be with someone who makes you feel alone never rung more true to me than tonight fuckit honestly i'm just looking for people to say their experiences
currently out with my wife for nye and i can t stop my anxiety and depression from trying to ruin our night i m trying really hard to contain myself i overthink everything
did n't want to make it to 2020
fucking hell im so fucked up i can t keep going on like this 
new years eve woo i'm pretty good on keeping my depression under wraps i can feel joy and i'm usually not super depressed , but its honestly got to me today i have a few best friends two here , and one in chicago i ca n't go to chicago , obviously , seeing that i live hours away the other two are at parties of their own , and i have n't gotten a text from the one in chicago i feel very alone and its scares me i feel like a pansy saying that , seeing that i'm such a big guy with a lot of care i want to tell them hey i'm not doing very well but they 're all drunk or high and i ca n't actually get my thoughts across to them help
i m so depressed that i disconnected with my friends and family , even though i love them now , no one even text me happy new year any
how do you get over feeling sad about the passing of time \? i feel horrible when i think of how quickly time is passing it makes me wonder , what am i even doing with my life \? i feel like life is just passing me by , and one day it ll be too late for me to do certain things life just feels too damn short
new year s eve with strangers celebrated nye with mostly people i don t know really wish i had at least someone to talk to drank a bunch
i did n't want to make it to 2020 really wanted to die this year , or atleast before my next birthday i 'll probably make it past that due to my lack of will to do anything inability to change or get better hope you can enjoy the new year regardless
if depressions doesn t kill me , loneliness will 
looks like i'm spending new year 's at my favorite bar alone again i dont really know what i'm looking for with this , just kinda to vent i guess , anyways i have like , 2 close friends and they 're both introverts , so there has n't been one year where i 've actually had solid plans , but , the last couple years i 've been going out to a bar i frequent and it 's been pretty hit or miss , some years they have regulars that show up and everyone has a good time , other years i wind up alone and depressed , and it looks like this is going to be one of those years where i'm just completely alone , which completely sucks because i really needed a win lately
holidays suck i always hate holidays because it seems like i notice how lonely i really am during them like everyone else my age \( 21 \) is out partying and having fun on new year s eve and i m just lonely it really sucks
happy new year my wife finally called me to tell me she is in love with a foreign man i know she s coming home , has to leave that man behind , but i m not sure how to move forward she blamed me for treating her bad yelled at me for being mad at her for not messaging me or calling me divorce might be plausible but without money , i could lose my son and i can not let that happen my depression has hit an all time low if i wasn t a father , i d consider ending it now trying so hard to stay positive for my son but i m at a breaking point
remembering another time if you see the boy i used to be tell him i m searching for him i ve been searching for a long ti
next year i m gonna make the effort to not check social media around holiday time it s just too depressing seeing everyone with their friends or having a blast with their families makes me sad and honestly really jealous i swear these last few days i ve been ruining my own mood by going on snapchat and or twitter i ve been doing it every single holiday and every single holiday and feel like garbage and don t enjoy myself i m tired of not enjoying myself
feel like a fucking zombie all of my emotions are gone i don t even feel sad anymore i just feel nothing can anyone else relate \?
i want it to stop 
lifes hitting me hard but i am trying to overcome it just a lot of shitty things happening all on this which is the last day of the year how great is that , right \? my parents are starting to become massive dicks over the past day and today was just another fight , my friend group excluded me from an event and kicked me from a group chat , girl i grew fond of called me an asshole and blocked me after i told her i was busy and smaller little things adding up so much shit is happening but i am just trying to overcome it because i am not doing anyone including myself favors over wallowing over it
i'm not sure what to do i want to cry , but i ca n't i want to scream , but i ca n't i feel like my entire being is trying to wail in pain , but i cant seem to accept it i find my self beating my own head or chocking my self trying to find a way to purge these thoughts and feeling from my mind , but i dont know if theres anything else i can do even if i keep trying to move forward i just dont see a point i dont think ill make it to 20 i just want it all to be over and for it all to end i want to run away

being alive is fucking exhausting 
overwhelmed by how little i feel i 've become emotionally numb to the sorts of moments that seemingly used to be exempt from my depression and it 's creating this antsy discomfort in me during moments like watching the new year 's ball drop where i expect to have a brief respite and instead just continue to feel nothing the emptiness is oddly jarring even though it 's a common guest throughout my day to day life i think that in the past even though i generally had that distance from everything i would still feel a little pang of something during special moments and now that even that it is n't happening anymore it just sends me into this lost confused state instead like when you 're absent mindedly walking down a familiar staircase and take one step too many and for a moment nothing makes sens
people in this world i hate when people say you should be happy you should be grateful that you re alive , grateful that you re breathing but what if i didn t ask to be alive i m not happy i understand i should be because people have it worse but there s nothing i can do about it why not just let me live the life i never asked for you should be grateful i m not selfish enough to kill myself i ve tried multiple times staying under the limit if i really really wanted to i d be dead already just let me live my own lif

doesn t feel like a new year when every day feels the exact same every day i wake up , and all i do is obsess about the guy who abused me that is literally all i do , every single day 623 days of thinking about him now , since the day he first messaged me every thing reminds me of him every song , every thing i see , and everything that i do it doesn t matter i can t stop thinking about him and i am just going to accept the fact that i can t stop fuck
was having a shit day before i even realized it was new years eve now it s more depressing to think how another year has gone by and i still feel worthless as ever most likely more cheers
i just want to drop dead i do n't even want to kill myself , i just want to either drop dead spontaneously or stop existing living is exhausting , and i do n't even know what to do with life anymore it feels pointless and directionless
my depression poem it s my first ever poem so please don t be too mean some people say they ve had it tough well as a kid i would often look rough for my mother was a useless junkie too hooked to get off the stuff she ruined me and my brother destroyed the future we had and for that i hate you mother you ve made me really mad my head now spins with thoughts most of them aren t very nice and all of this could end with one faithful slice but although my head is fucked and i can t see the light there s always another way you just need to fight mental health awareness
off to a great start i m crying on my bed 1 hour into 2020 because i hate myself ughhh i hate myself and i hate my life right now i literally feel like i can t do this like oh my god why am i that way that i am \? \? nobody likes me not even myself and with good reason i don t want to die but i would love to just disappear somewh

new year , same loneliness not like i hoped that i would feel magically better i just have been feeling lonely as hell lately even when i am surrounded by friends , i feel like i am alone and that no one would ever care if i was suddenly no longer there i hate that i am stuck in this rut i hate that i am not normal i hate that i cannot just be happy i hate that i cannot just exist without tremendous pain i want to not hate myself for just five minutes is it that hard \?
i guess this is depression isolation , silence , avoidance , not caring about anything holidays , new years , old friends i am numb i do n't care about any of it and i'm ready to give up through a toxic relationship i have lost myself completely , lost all motivation it 's left me so alone i'm really only doing the bare minimum to get by it 's rough i am ready to live off grid somewh
what a way to start the new year it 's funny i find myself thinking , why am i alive \? why ca n't i be dead yet but i made a resolution i'm going to start marking my days as good or bad if there are more bad days , i 'll commit suicide if there are more good days , i 'll actually try to live and get real help if i break even somehow , i 'll do this again next year this is my resolution
i don t care about new years eve i just finished crying because i know i will have to deal with life s bullshit for the next 10 years if i even make it past 5 years it ll be a miracle i don t know how i m still hanging on
2020 well i'm not as drunk going into the new year as i was last year but i think i'm 100 times more depress

out of reach these days i always feel like real happiness and connection and love and friendship are always going to be out of reach , and all i'm left with are these shitty fakes that do nothing but make me aware of it i do n't know if i'm just being dramatic or something
i am so immeasurably bored with life my skull feels like it s going to split open i don t have a headache , my body is just ready to burst away from this fruitless shit even at my highest moments surrounded by friends i just want it to fucking end already i have multiple hobbies that i enjoy in the moment \( still weighted down by my crumbling mental state \) , i am physically active and fit , and was born into a pretty goos situation but here we fucking are , and even though i seemed to have won life s lottery i still lost because existing simply is not worth it

i'm lost what the fuck i always knew people experienced life like this but i never thought it was going to happen to me , too i have never been this alone in my life , or felt like it finishing highschool helped me realize it , new years made me realize it even more i do n't know why i keep expecting some kind of attention for me it never happens maybe i was expecting some kind of message of new years , even when i have not received any kind of text for a week completely forgotten , ca n't blame anyone i'm only 17 and i am fucking doomed in this worl

there 's a void inside me im sure more than one can feel this , but i do n't know everyday keeps getting worse im trying to have hope that it changes at least a little bit but i'm slowly giving up on that , everyday you just feel how it consumes you from the inside , the wounds in my arms and legs are a way to try to relief that feeling they are like a distraction at least for some minutes
i have a question sooo does anyone really just want to disappear or want to try something but is just too lazy too , or just too unmotivated to do anything because that s how i feel , i really just hate the place i ve been in for the last few months and it s starting to really really get to me i just want to be unknown so i can die without hurting people or just disappear without people wondering where i went although the other thing is i have no motivation to do those things or even anything , if i could i would melt into my bed and stay there forever fuck new years
great decade opener girlfriend asleep next to me , great job , sweet car , and all i want to do right now is blow my brains out everything about life is such bullshit friendships , coworkers , clubs , all that nonsense everything is goin great until i stop for a few minutes and think about things , then i realize i hate everything about life and just wish for it to be over happy new year hope your 2020 is as great as you hope it will b

in between \? can you relate can you help with the place of in between like a dark deep hole , endless endless in its recollection and recount yet accepting and happy for restart and new hope but the place in between is too magnetic
bad things are coming i recently started taking meds and i guess they 've helped me a bit the holidays has been a mixed bag of really shit and good days , but definitely way more good than usual but i 've got this sinking sensation that its all gonna fall apart soon , once i have to go back my family is luckily super supportive so its actually been good being here but i know its just a fantasy land i'm living in , that all the progress i 've made will fly out the window once i return to the real world the only reason i 've been able to be slightly happy is because i have n't been thinking at all about the future \( somehow , probably though constant distraction \) , immediate and the nothing beyond that idk whats gonna happen to 
imma probably die from drugs this year i m a full blown drug addict as i m 20 years old and can t stop using meth and i don t think i ll ever be able to stop unfortunately i ve been to rehab and sober houses and still didn t work as i would rather trade my life for these drugs

another year alone asked 3 girls out this year they all said no , nobody is ever going to care about 
anyone else worried that life would be boring if they got better \? i know that logically i could get sober , take a serious focus on my issues , force myself to think positively , etc but if i did all of that then my life would be empty i would be like everyone else , with no conflict and no happiness to strive for because i would already be content with my life maybe the only thing that gives my life meaning is my constant war with myself i do n't know who i would be if i won
i wish i could give my life to someone who actually wants to live fuck new years by the way
i feel different , abnormal , inferior to other people i ca n't rationally explain why i feel like this i just do it feels like everyone else is normal and happy and loved except 
getting help or realizing your not able to do it yourself getting help for depression is good but why ca n't we just do it ourselves and no , i'm not one of those people who tell you to snap out of it i'm just saying when someone is depressed they might wonder to themselves why they ca n't just do it without help getting advice from a therapist is good , but having to ask for help because it 's gotten too far might make others feel useless without other people and i'm really confused because i do n't know what 's best for anything anymore this did n't make sense to most but for you who did understand , thank you \? x
i am in vegas to watch the countdown and just cried i honestly don t know why i went to vegas to watch the countdown but i went and was in the crowd , i manage to find a empty spot and sat down from a short distance from everyone else but still being able to see the fireworks and what not , when it was 30 , 29 , 28 , 27 i just started tearing up in sadness and the 3 , 2 , 1 just made me grief stricken , i don t know what to do with my life anymore , i don t think i can be alone again for another yea
already welp , this year already sucks ass here s to another miserable 366 days , you sad fucks uwu
tired i'm tired my pain is a full time job ive battled this for so long and i just dont have the fight left in me the only one i have to talk with is so desensitized to my suffering , that he 's grown detached from it all im tired i open up to the world and then i'm labelled as negative and dramatic i try so hard to look at the positives but i have n't had many lately there 's little i can enjoy anymore there 's nothing that can make it better my heart feels like it 's clouded with a dark ghost of the past it drains my joy it drains my spark i can be surrounded by people and feel like the loneliest person no one seems to genuinely care at least not for long help never comes i'm tired of waiting
i ve told my family i m depressed several times , but when i get in one of those moods where i just do not want to talk to anyone and get snappy , they still ask what is wrong with you \? this is not normal i fucking know don t make me explain it again how i want to die 
why do i continue to share my thoughts to the world when no one in it agrees with them \? i have poor social relationships because i'm too different from everyone else i'm open and blunt about everything i see wrong and i guess that 's a cause for concern that paints me into an asshole fuck your world if you like it the way it is
i have never been so sad at new years yesterday i literally broke down and cried for an hour , and nobody noticed i was n't there i started the new year with sobbing and red eyes great
together i'm not one to tell you how to feel i'm just as broken as everyone here we feel alone but in all actually , we are here for each other , together not much encouragement here to help you move on because i'm not there myself , but we as a whole should try life i shitty for all of us but we are here for one another i wish i was as positive as it may seem , but there 's always a tomorrow that 'll give us pain when and if that pain hopefully goes away , we can all help each other to get through the pain

i opened up about my problems and got insulted a while ago , my mom was making comments about my body , and since i have a very low self esteem , i do n't really handle that very well i eventually told her that she should stop making these comments because i have low self esteem and it hurts me when she does that she then said that maybe i'm just too sensitive and should n't overreact like that about a simple harmless comment

just so exhausted no matter how much or the right amount of sleep i get i'm so exhausted , i thought maybe it was exhausting me keeping all my emotions bottled up and not crying when i felt like crying \( cause i was at work and then at a nye party \) and when i found the time i let myself cry and feel everything and now i'm even more exhausted than i was before i was happy a few weeks ago , everything was light and freeing and i got so much done and it didnt feel like a burden doing it and now i'm back here again , it 's so dreadful i would rather die than go through this again

i do n't know why i'm depressed i have been feeling down for about 3 weeks i do n't know why or exactly when it started i'm usually doing alright in the day , meaning i dont feel suicidal or too depressed but in the evenings i feel so lonely and depressed i get suicidal i am 16 years old and i have always hated drugs and alcohol but i got a friend who said he can sell some weed \( which is fairly uncommon where i live \) and i drank some alcohol my dad had after my parents went to sleep i do n't feel like burdening anyone with telling them how i feel but i do n't know what to do anymore i'm really considering buying the weed and just smoking my problems away

its getting really bad i need someone to talk to about this im thinking about dying every day from the time i wake up , while i lay around in bed all day , and cry myself to sleep it 's getting so bad i do n't want to live or try to fix things anymore and a part of me is trying to reach out for help bc it is scaring me i have no health coverage , and i have children who i know need me but i am not even here mentally or emotionally for them i ca n't feel anything but pain and negativity and i ca n't escape this it 's winning and i ca n't fight anymore like i used to everyday i want to die please i really need someone to talk to without fear of being locked up or treated badly
recommendations for other subreddits i need recommendations for other subreddits related to mental health i m currently in a recovery uphill from my depression and anxiety , but i have to leave this subreddit due to the constant negativity from other sufferers reading posts relating to self deprication and suicide makes my negative thoughts and memories trickle back it s not a good cycle sometimes i think i can stay here to help and listen , but more often that not , being in this community is more of a burden on my health i was wondering if anyone is in any other subreddits that encourage positivity and mindfulness \?

i understand for some depression is fake , it untrue feelings and negative thinking for me it 's real it 's my existence it 's all i inevitably feel \( my first trip was so amazing at first but so reality next it 's not just negative thinking its real feelings , that i know in my heart is true because it is true i had so much fantasy that i imagined to make life lovable and tolerable now it 's just fear that stops me from escaping my fate i was so hoping for help and guidance \( i'm just going to seek escape where i can and just accept it it 's just so painful to be so alone and unwant

do y alls diagnoses ever hit you randomly shortly after my 19th birthday , i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety i know they re typical disorders , but to put an actual label on what i am is so surreal to me before i received the diagnoses , i would refrain from using words like depressed or anxious and would say sad and overwhelmed because i felt wrong jumping to conclusions without the proper identification for these moods it still hits me every once and a while though , i m so much more broken than i think i am and i have so much that is actually wrong with me it s heartbreaking to know the truth about my conditions and to see what i will be seen as for the rest of my life by anyone who will try and help 
i think one of the most powerful things about depression is that i really really want help , but for the life of me i ca n't make myself actually buckle down and actually source a good psych and go through that entire process i hate feeling so empty , hopeless , and unwanted but everytime i say to myself ok , i am going to do it this time i am going to go over to my computer , look up psychs that take my insurance and make an appointment i just go well maybe tomorrow the thing about tomorrow is that it never comes

new year reflection after time in a ward , on and then eventually of medication , i found myself understanding how to live with depression for me it s like a constant song playing , i used to hate the tune , and it ll do , it s terrible , it makes me cry , feel alone and isolated , but the tune is mine and even though it play all the time , i be learned to kind of love it it s no longer a dreaded sound but a comforting one learning to accept it takes away the burning i go to sleep alone on the new year , but at least i m me i hope this gets lost in new

everyone wants to act like they 're supportive of mentally ill people until they actually meet one i get it , we 're exhausting to deal with , but it 's fucking infuriating when you see someone pretending like they give a shit about mental health when you know they 'd just write you off as an asshole or a weirdo as soon as you existed around them with a mental illness i'm not sure if it 's just a circle jerk of people trying to act selfless or if they just do n't understand what mental illness looks lik

why does no one realize that depression starts in the body it seems like no one here even realizes that depression , anxiety , and other mental health issues start within the body methylation issues are a major cause of depression and yet not a lot of people even know this i didn t used to realize that i could fix my depression and mental health issues and i think i was just stupid it seems like it should be common sense that something is wrong when depression happens but the medical industry has sidetracked everyone into thinking all they can do is take medication fuck the world and humanity and fuck me this is everyone s fault that mental illness is such a problem no one is even doing shit about it to get people bett

i tried to kill myself yesterday 
a burden i m exhausted this past year has been hell , filled with fights and disruptions because no one understands how depressed i am , and how fucking tangled i feel in my thoughts and feelings i lash out at important people because they refuse to wrap their head around what i m feeling , yet i put everything out there to understand and relate to them i m tired of being here i m miserable i m empty i m unhappy i don t want to see the end of 2020
i feel like a fraud i m always very positive and preppy around others the second i m alone , i break down and start wondering if it s even worth me being alive , all this work and fake smiles just to what \? go in debt trying to graduate \? fake my way with family and friends \? i feel so fake having to pretend i m not thinking about how bad i d like to kill myself on a regular basis
i can t bear the thought of living another year that s why when people seem so excited about this new decade , i m like are you serious \? like this last year between my ptsd and depression and anxiety , i ve probably cried a buckets worth and i m hurting everyday just the thought of doing that another year actually kills me inside i called the suicide lifeline twice yesterday and they helped me it s just like i don t get the point
sometimes i wonder if everyone that i love would be better off now if i had killed myself the last time i tried

the first person to say anything to me in 2020 screamed profanity at me the details don t matter but i was stunned by my reaction i ve been yelled at plenty of times by teenagers i ve worked with in previous jobs so profanity and being screamed at doesn t bother me necessarily but my physical and emotional reaction was extremely intense i shut down completely today it was like a switch it was just flooding i was reminded by my mom and dad screaming at me when i was a kid how am i 33 years old and this shit still bothers me \?

my tears mean nothing 
how do you deal with being an absolute social failure in life \? first of all , i can t relate to anyone i meet , i stutter all the time , i space out whenever i try to make conversation , and my social anxiety and introversion either inhibit my ability to talk to certain people or i just avoid conversation entirely i can t even set up a date to meet up with some of my old friends because my anxiety is fucking my ass left and right and assuming the worst every time how do i deal with this horrible reality and not have suicidal thoughts about it \?

weird depression does anybody else have these weird periods of time when you feel confident , like you could do anything feel productive and are productive , even happy and more sociable than ever and then it just goes downhill from there and you start to feel like you 're going to cry , so you spend most of the day trying not to cry \( specially when there are people around \) all the things you did seem meaningless , so you just kind of stop trying at first i thought it was because i had commitment issues or i was too lazy but now i do n't know anymore , it has been like this for about a year and a half it like being in a roller coaster i fear it might be something els

information needed what is the easiest way to kill myself with least pain possible \?
desolation depression is writing sick poetry on skin and publishing it with scars , cutting on ankles , not wrists because you re scared you ll get in trouble but you so desperately need to be seen , and never are depression is writing the word alone and seeing the word home , accepting the pain like a gift because you deserve it depression is admitting suicidal thoughts to paper and not to people , and loving the broken things , hoping to tie them together , thinking maybe things will get better , but knowing that s just wishful thinking

look me in the eye and tell me it gets better go out , too out of your mind with sleep deprivation to be coherent , sit around at home feeling like shit in all respects , have both of your parents dismiss that anything 's wrong while pouring gas on the fire by being passive aggressive every time they interact with you , and when it seems like things might change , whether it 's your own efforts or the environment just shifting , it all circles back to being the same again the ride never ends

i am forgetting how it felt to feel happy it has been so long , i do not remember how it feels to feel happy when i see , hear or remember happiness it makes me feel even more depressed i just feel like i am sitting in the dark everyday and as time passes it feels harder and harder to escape i just want to sit down and not have to battle every thought in my mind and expend all my daily energy towards acting normal

i'm really close to the edge when i die i'm going to just be another statistic and fade into obscurity it 's not worth it to be here i just wish i could be here to see the faces of all the people who made me miserable when i die i hope they rot i 'll be forgotten i 'll be nothing but an empty vessel it 's so calming i ca n't wait home is where the hatred is by scott heron on repeat , that song is a masterpiece i want to kill myself , but for now i'm going to take a long , long nap and hopefully the depression will subside and i can have a will to live again hopefully

feeling constantly unsatisfied and restless i'm feeling constantly dissatisfied and stuck , i recently started being independent , working and living on my own and although i'm progressing with my job , once i get home i feel restless and need to do something i thought maybe i'm sexually frustrated but being ugly has its perks , i turn myself off so i do n't like the idea of me having sex even if i know some people are willing to do it with me i also thought of trying extreme sports or try new drugs but it 's all temporary i am tired of being boring and having no motivation does anyone feel the same or that 's how adulthood normally feels and i should not think much about it \?

i'm trying to quit smoking i'm 3 days free and am holding my own but , now i'm asking myself why \? what 's the point \? nobody is gonna care anyway and i'm basically taking away the one thing i actually enjoy in life am i just torturing myself for a false sense of self improvement \? or is this just a part of the process \? idk anymore fuck , i need a cigarett
why again a title i think i am fucked in the brain but it 's ok nobody really cares anyway and i will never escape this , be myself or be what i want to b
recently i realized i don t remember the last time i actually felt a genuine emotion , where i didn t have to fake my reaction to everything i genuinely don t care about anything and i have to give a generic emotional response to everything it s crazy i didn t notice this until recently but i guess this just gives me more reason to fight through this shit , idk about you guys but i wanna feel again
do you need help \? my father asks me alright im exagerating but my father always tells me something similar to this first off he 's kind and asks how i feel , then he goes on to ask if we should search help and i say i do n't know then he says you 'll end up lonely , isolated , fed drugs and not allowed to get out of your room , they 'll destroy your life and no girl will ever want to lay her hands on you
angsty teen i'm 17 and i have a mild moderate depression at home im usually in my room and only leave to eat and to take our dog fpr a walk nowadays i do n't really voluntarily talk to my family members like i answer if someone asks me something , but do n't start conversations i do n't know why but it 's just exhausting and makes me irritated somehow that 's why at home i usually seem to be angry but i just want to be left alone if u did n't understand i can try to clarify
depression has changed my perception of what is good and bad in life i want my life to improve really i do n't want to live this fucking mess anymore but i also do n't know how i want my live to get better or to improve it so i'm happier it feels like my perception of everything is so fucked that i could n't even find happieness if it is directly infront of 
depression from loneliness is the worst cycle ever i hate it so much , i dont have anyone because im depressed , but also depression makes me so devoid of life so that it 's difficult to keep or make friends , just feels like it digs me deeper and deeper , idk just feels like im getting to a breaking point honestly
why should i even continue i hate my job i hate the house i live in i have no friends i feel like me getting a boyfriend would equal to kidnapping and torturing someone because of how much baggage i have , no one in their right mind should date me and experience this none of my hobbies make me happy anymore my eating disorder is making every second of my waking moments miserable both mentally and physically so why should i bother any
i'm done 22 male i'm going to kill myself i keep hesitating whenever i try to slit my throat but i'm going to do it now i hate living it 's unbearable having to wake up every day and exist , the same shit over and over i know this sounds stupid but the final straw was cutting my hair i grew my hair out for nearly two years and was being pestered to cut it and i was angry at the time so i ended up snapping and cutting it over a month ago i look fucking horrible with short hai

just wanna give up on everything i 've never had something hit me so hard i'm crashing and burning love will fuck you up worse than any drug ! everything reminds me of him absolutely everything i ca n't function right all i wanna do is hold hi
the older i grow the more i'm convinced nobody actually wants to be alive like seriously , does anybody out there actually wake up in the morning with a smile on their face when nobody is looking \? i think happy people are people who are so delusional that they somehow convince themselves that slaving your life away is a good reason to keep going until cancer or heart disease claims you or maybe it 's those who remain in that early childhood mindset where everything is beatiful and fun and worth exploring ignorance is bliss , i guess \? what 's the point \?

life s kicking my ass dead ass , everyday has sucked for a while i feel so lonely i have no friends to hang out with due to them being in a relationship i m at a new college , my gf is too busy for me , the only human interaction i have is with my family or at work but i m still trying to find a way to be happy
i almost broke down crying at school today my friends have changed so much i was sitting in history class , the last period , and i was so exhausted i am unsure why it was a normal \( exhausting is usual as i m sure we all know \) day except that at recess , there was a brawl between the two popular kid groups kids who i was literally best friends with who went and left me to lead these so i guess maybe it was watching them beat eachother up that triggered it if anyone saw endgame , it was similar to the battle with dr strange s portals
i'm stuck at a point where i ca n't even explain what 's wrong with me there is a point in your depression where you just give up on getting better but you still won t kill yourself you just float around in this state of nothingness and don t notice anything around you because you re just so numb and you just don t want to anything about it any
i do n't know if i should get help i do n't know if i should like confess it because they probably would n't believe me or if i do get help everybody will act different towards me and i do n't want that cause i hate being at the center of attention i just wanna disappear nobody talk to me , nobody pay attention to me but i know if i do get help maybe i will get better and get over it

boring , but good in my last post i talked about feeling manic and uncaring but now that i think about it , it 's a combination of distancing myself from my over caring attitude and simp mentality in many ways depression is a result of caring too much it 's not that you should n't care about things , but it 's understanding which people and things in your life are simply not worth your energy
i'm tired from crying 
you are not alone , even if it feels that way 
im gonna kill myself on the 29 decided this now , everything will be better without me and i wont feel pain any

will i feel like this forever \? i 've been dealing with what i am hesitant to call depression for some time now maybe a couple years , but when i look back at what i felt like back then it seems to pale in comparison with right now it 's been getting worse and worse of late , by the day , really for the past two or so weeks , however , it 's been worse than ever before i feel like i 've fallen into some hole that 's getting deeper and deeper around me the best way to describe it is one long low grade panic attack that does n't show any signs of letting up i'm terrified of the future and i do n't know what to do i want to get better but i just do n't know how any

how do i avoid eating my feelings \? the title seems so dumb once i wrote it out i 've been feeling so low for the last two weeks and my only source of happiness in that time is the fleeting joy i get from eating disgustingly unhealthy food or smoking weed and then eating disgustingly unhealthy food but i hear the same advice over and over that exercise and good diet are the two best things you can do for managing depression sans medication i do n't know why i'm writing this out i just hear from people close to me how bad my diet is usually they 're just poking fun at me but it legitimately feels like it 's the only thing in life i look forward to any
weed it is legal where i live should i try this as a way to cope with depression \? is this a good idea \? thank you
people only searches me when they need help it 's been months since i had a conversation , even on text , about something that is not related to school i always feel like people is nice to me just because they need help from me in something it 's really depressing i 've been thinking about suicide a lot lately a student in my school killed himself 2 weeks ago and everybody cried about his death for one or two days , then everything went back to normal if it 's so easy to be forgotten , i do n't even want to try to be remembered i do n't even know why i'm posting this i just need to vent somewhere i hope someone can relat
depression is like a serpent in one second she was dead , all that suffering eventually got to her and she died i'ts a tragedy , people scream and ask why \? did n't you see , she was suffering for years , she cried and begged for help but you did n't listen , you instead blamed her for being lazy or just spoiled this is the problem , you think that you know better than us but you dont know , you 're the lucky spoiled on here , not having to suffer from this every single day you should n't even dare to judge us unless you 've gone through something similar those words you spew out only make the serpent grow stronger until people actually loose hope sorry for my ramblings i just had to write this down

i want to be like others but i ca n't ! i'm sorry i really am but i just cant fit in with others , my depression has truly changed me as a person and it 's hard for me to relate to others who dont suffer from it i want to have fun and go out and do the stuff teenagers do but i ca n't it 's like this barrier between me and the rest maybe i'm just too ill and need help , but i guess mental illness 's are still not taken seriously \(
i havnt had the thoughts in a long time it s just been a really bad monday and last week was stressful i m working so hard but i feel so useless and unaccomplished i try not to compare myself , but how can i not when i m constantly surrounded by those better than me \? my past keeps haunting my mind in any task i do i just can t shake those memories i just want to give up i want release i m in uni and this week is hard and i m really sick i feel like people think i exaggerate my sickness , but i truly feel absolutely horrible no one understands how i really feel or what s happening in my head i ll just keep hiding it i don t know

i do n't understand how i feel i have times when i'm fine but have times when i feel so helpless i know life is only going to get worse and far too afraid to try to help there 's nothing i 've even got to be sad over my life is perfectly fine , but then i find myself just feeling so helpless i do n't want to find out how much worse life can get , this already feels enough
depression suppressed everything else , even hunger i always feel guilty and i always feel like i don t deserve what i get i m an idiot , yet somehow i got into a really good college it haunts me everyday and i can never shake it or depression off it eats away at me and stops me from doing so much every time i m hungry while doing something like homework or studying i always in my head end up telling myself , you don t deserve to eat and then my hunger magically disappears for a while but even when it doesn t , it takes me forever to make food i have a hard time even cutting myself anymore and it s my way of self punishment i hate my life , but more than anything i hate myself

i just want people i can talk to i just feel so fucking lonely , and i am i 've tried talking to ppl on various subreddits but i just end up getting ghosted its pretty much impossible for me to make friends irl , my social anxiety is horrible and i have panic attacks often i wish i had close friends that cared about me and i could talk to about anything , and do the same for them i am sick and tired of this shitty lonely lif

i fucking hate how my problems have no solutions i can t fix the futility i feel when i live my life , i can t fix the anger i have of being a slave to the world and my biology , and i can t fix how i feel about living in this stupid hell world i m so empty inside and it only gets worse everyday i m too tired of living and i have no interest or motivation to go on life is so agonizing and it pisses me off life is stupid and i just want to leave this world f
you do n't have to do anything exept of dying no matter what you have reached in your life no matter if you have sinned or not no matter if you have children or a wife we 're all gonna die why does everyone have to go through the same thing i do n't know if im really depressed or smth , but i know if i reach my dreams , some day i lose it all i lose everything why do i have to go through the circle of life if i know that it does n't matter why do n't end it here and know it does n't matter any
i'm such a failure i'm such a disgusting person i'm a really bad person i do n't deserve to be alive i should just end it i'm tired of the guilt and regrets
all of my friends are moving 2 hours to a bigger city without me i m gonna be stuck in a small town i hate with nobody to talk to i really wanted to move with them and they knew it they made the plans one night when i wasn t around and i m sad about that i hate my hometown and want to have fun with my friends but maybe i wasn t meant to be happy i ve been trying to better myself and really want to my life to turn around it s just hard to get out of bed without anyone to go hang out with or talk to face to fac

there s so much darkness , i can t do it anymore f26 do you ever think there s nothing to keep you going except for what you ll put your close family through if you end it \? i think that s the only thing stopping me but on the other hand i think they d be better off without me i feel like such a burden on everyone they ve told me i should be doing better by now but i ve only gotten worse i just can t do it any
i m so sick of hearing life is not one big party and similar sentiments yes i understand that life is one big party but if life is miserable every day why fucking bother \? i don t understand this attitude of yes life does suck get over it then my question is why bother \? the only metaphor that i can think of is going to see a movie say i go to the theater and the movie sucks , what would a rational person do \? they would walk out of the theater you catch my drift \?
i still have a suicide note even though im doing fine , maybe even good i still keep it because i know that one day the inevitable will still happen i will still hit those lows

nothing is exciting anymore , friends , hobbies all gone i m sure y all feel the same what used to put a smile on your face no longer does everyday seems to fade into the next no sleep no friends motivation to do the smallest tasks is gone geez , hard to imagine a life better than this when it s been the same bs for years odd to see others having the time of their life in a college town while you struggle to even make a friend anyone else in the same boat \?
feeling suicidal i 've recently been feeling suicidal but i know my family is gonna be sad n shit and i do n't know what to do i need help

friends 13m i dont really have any close friends , i am just a side character i cant focus during the school day and after i physically cannot do my homework or study people annoy me for fun or tell me to kill myself and it just echos through my head then after when i try to sleep i lay in bed for hours life just sucks
might end it my idealized plan is this write a note get drunk on whatever shit my dad has lying around grab a rope sneak out at around 1 in the morning take the t to downtown boston get some fried chicken or whatever 's open at that hour find a small bridge or something along the charles river do a do plenty of time to reconsider but not too much room to think about it since i will hopefully be inebriat
i need help for my friend so recently my friend went through a breakup and though i don t know the full details , it was kinda a nasty one and now their friend group is starting to take sides and everyone is taking the other person s side so it seems like my friend doesn t have anyone at all and now she s showing signs of depression not eating , always tired , etc what i m asking is for advice on what i can do say to help her through this tough ti
alone i dont know why , but im happy i sometimes get sad too , but mostly happy you may ask whats wrong with that \? well , i dont have friends , i literally dont i really want to meet someone new , but my social anxiety and my insicurities lock me down
i hate myself i 've never known how to love myself i look at myself in the mirror and see a disgusting demon , a morbid creature , someone i despise more and more everyday i do n't deserve anything i ca n't help but cringe when people give me compliments i have no confidence in myself but want to achieve everything i'm stuck
i just want to feel safe again one day i stopped feeling safe and ''at home'' in my parents' arms and i yearn for that feeling so much depression is lonely
i don t know what to do i feel like there s no one i could talk to i don t want to go to a hospital or something but i feel if i actually told someone how i was feeling for what i thought they would try to send me to some place like that i just feel so fucking alon
crazy ! ! depressed ! its so crazy that you can be in a relationship and be so depressed when you tell your partner all they say is oh you always have an excuse its not an excuse you treat me like shit like i m nobody ! its not an excuse you show me no love ! i just don t want to be here anymore ! ! !
their days like this why don t i just do it already i feel like burden onto my family with i just wished things would be better but i know that it not going to happen any time soon i wish i had that courage to kill myself but i don t so i just live on try to li
my life isn t my own anymore if my life was my own then i d fucking kill myself asap but no , i couldn t do that to my parents , friends , or boyfriend it would be too much of an emotional burden for them meanwhile , i m out here not wanting to do anything at all i don t want a future , there s nothing else i want to do in life but i m compelled to continue living because of them not only am i compelled to continue living on this earth , i m compelled to be good to them and hide my sadness and pain from my parents at least no one wants to be around someone who is in emotional turmoil all the time , but that s what i have to be around \( myself \) fuck this shit
help i ca n't get out of bed anymore i do n't even know why i should continue living i have no hope everyday is the same i'm losing my sanity why is it so painful \? why does everything hurt \? my mind is killing 
i am a failure and a depressant when people see me i watch the joy they had just dwindle away the more they talk to me i cripple the happiness of those i love because i cannot be fucking normal
forever alone i ve always felt this burning desire to have friendships and other meaningful relationships , yet every time i m hanging out with people i just feel lonely and would rather be alone unless i m drunk or high then if drunk or high around people i end up being an asshole that nobody wants to be around or i try to get too close to people and that pushes them away i m at a point where i m pretty much giving up and saying i m alone , or just might use people and stop giving a shit idk , anyone else have something similar \?
alternate universe imagine if there was another world , a fantasy world , a world where everything was right , where everything felt right a place where you could leave all this shit behind a place where you could leave this mental baggage behind a place where you felt safe a place where you felt happy a place where you never felt lonely a place where people actually understood you and accepted you for who you are but again that 's all a figment of my imagination
i feel like i'm wasting my life i'm 17 i'm in my senior year of high school i only have 3 classes then i come home and play video games i have no friends i hang out with , and nobody i talk to i contemplate suicide a lot , but i do n't think it 's something i could do i feel hopeless 24 7 and i'm not sure what to do about it anymore i just want to lie in bed and sob nothing brings me joy i wish i felt excited about things like i used to i often think that my feelings are n't valid and that i'm just 17 so i should n't feel like this i do n't know if anybody will read this , but if you do , thanks i suppos
i feel like my life has already peaked i m only 18 , but i feel like my life has peaked 2016 2018 were the best years of my life i would do crazy stuff with my friends all the time and just have a good time since the end of 2018 , i ve been a depressed sad sack i literally feel like a shell of a human my grades this past year have been awful i honestly don t care about anything anymore , and i rarely smile genuinely this sucks \(
my personality completely changed the first few weeks when i started sinking back into depression we re not sure its just depression , going to be doing more tests to see if theres another problem which there probably is but im scared im not myself i dont care about anything besides myself i used to be the most empathetic person not only my personality , but the way i perceive things it constantly feels like sensory overload going on i feel like im not here sometimes my hearing is fuzzy time doesnt feel like a thing my memory is shit both long term and short term its really making me even more depressed as these symptoms just start popping up its never really grabbed onto me this quickly so its scary im just sca
empty what do you do when you can literally see yourself going in a downward spiral but you have no motivation to buckle up \? i feel so empty , like the batteries in my brain are dead amp the store bought \( anti depressants \) are yunno not cutting it i just want to live a normal life without this illness its taken so many years of my life i cant get back amp i dont want it to take more than it has but damn its so freaking hard sometimes
i cut for the first time and now i m in some kind of conflict if i should tell my bf or not \? so i cut yesterday and today , even though i promised him that i notify him if i am really bad it s also not like i am really bad , i just couldn t keep my thoughts away from it i don t know what to do because i don t want him to be mad disappoint
how do i stay out of my head \? it s kinda strange really one moment i ll be totally ok , well relaxed then some minor detail sets me off on these awful spirals where i just feel terrible sometimes it s nothing at all and i just feel empty all of this happens when i m thinking , and i m just ignoring everything so , how am i supposed to stop doing this \? how do i live in the present when all i can think of is the past or future \?
heh it s back so for about the past month or 2 i ve been on and off depressed it sucks i finally feel happiness but then depression just comes back and tries to kill me i m gonna try my best to say happy but i don t know how it ll g
can i die yet i m so over life and being pushed around and belittled and told what to do i m in a relationship with someone who lives to make me miserable and make me feel as stupid and alone as possible i hate hate hate the fact that i m too much of a coward to kill myself i dont want to breathe anymore , im so over this shit
i hate my life so much my anxiety is killing me i hate my life , especially school i am always so anxious to the point i can t even breathe i self harm everyday \( even at school \) just to cope with my anxiety i know it s unhealthy , but i have given up and have no other option i have considered suicide numerous times but am too afraid to commit anyone i tell just lectures me and tells me to stop being a baby , just don t be anxious that doesn t help me at all i feel so helpless everyday is a living hell for me i wish i could fall asleep and never wake up
drugs amp depression does anyone else use drugs to cope with their feelings of depression \? if so which ones \? why \? how do they help you feel better \? etc
how to stop thinking about dying \? i m constantly thinking about ending my life and wishing i was dead already \( luckily , i guess \) i don t dare to do that at all just because i think i will hurt my parents a lot but i ve reached the point that every day i m just tired of existing and just wish an accident were to happen to me i don t have that many friends , i dislike my job , i m single , etc etc i live the stereotypical boring life of a loner i m also very unappealing , physically talking has anyone ever recovered from this point \? should i be getting any strong antidepressants \? i ve tried counseling once and it did not make me feel better at all
i hope i don t wake up tomorrow i don t think i want to do this anymore kinda wish the attempt had work

i do n't think there is anything worse for depression than being a stay at home mom it 's so lonely and just so hard it takes all my energy to care for my 3yo , and i crash emotionally after bedtime between him and our three pets , the apartment is never clean i love my son so much and i worry that i'm not doing enough for hi

i feel like i ve ceased to exist and in my place is just a ball of mental illness me 5 years ago isn t the same person i am now i m not even a person anymore , because people have actual thoughts all i think about is when will i have to eat , when will i break next , when will i do something stupid in public again i haven t felt ok in so long that i don t remember what it feels like to not be horribly depressed and hungry all the time i don t see how it will ever get better at all
back to square one i was 5150 d which turn into the consecutive holds they got me on new medicine while i was at the facility and for a month everything seemed to be going good my life is the best it s been in a while right now yet i can t help but feel depressed and all i want is to just die it really seems like i m going to be stuck like this for the rest of my lif

i dont really know im just like depressed i have no clue how to fix it without going to a facility or therapist \( they 've never helped \) and family , school , relationship issues really dont help i just feel like im at my rope 's end and everything is hope helpless this post could be me crying for someone to come and tell me that im worth something and it may be very selfish , but i dont know what to do any
the worst part of depression is the instinct to pull everyone else down to my leve one of my close friends posted in a private discord server i hope everyone had a wonderful day today i love you all so muchly and i just feel like such shit because my fist impulse was to let her know that she was wrong my day was in fact very shitty and it 's so frustrating that i 'd rather say that then accept the sentiment and be cheered by her words she also struggles with depression so it just feels like my impulse to respond with negativity is this weird desire to pull her down to my level like , i get that sometimes happiness is not possible but why do i frequently feel this impulse to be bitter and negative to the people supporting me \?
2 times i 've wanted to go inside the bathrooms and hang myself with my tie everyday i think about killing myself and sometimes it gets to the point i wanted to do it at school , but i ca n't do it because i 've made a promise to my friends , and sometimes i feel like breaking my promise , one time i was full on ready to die i was riding my bike and i closed my eyes and let go of the handle bars , but i opened them up again because of the deal , i want the pain to end but i do n't know if i want to get better or not
well this is n't good i never thought i would be posting on here but i 've just hit a rock bottom point i lost all of my friends , my family does n't support nor care about me i pretty much have no one now i'm completely alone , and all i have are my thoughts to torture me every single day , during the day and now in my dreams every so often i'm completely full of anxiety and i'm sca
i just do n't want to burden people why ca n't they just forget about me \? i told some people about my issues and i 've only caused them discomfort , anxiety they do n't deserve this any more than i do , so why should i bleed on to those i care about \? i'm scared of my loved ones because i do n't want to hurt them i do n't want to be with my girlfriend anymore but it would devastate her if she found out things would be so much easier if they all forgot about me writing this here instead of my notes gives this some form of legitimacy , and i'm sorry dear reader that you sat through this vague , incomprehensible bullshit if i delete this again before posting it i'm going to go insan
some one help me identify whats wrong with me please \? my brain fells like it runs at 200 all the time ten different thoughts in one go , i will be think about when i can kill myself something i said or did earlier something embarrassing about my past 'how i miss my siblings if i walk past some thing like a canal i can think on what year it got made l , how it was made , social constructs on that era all in an instant i overthink situations and make possible scenarios of things that will never happen i fell a breath away from a panic attack mood swings atleast 3 or 4 aday its really tiring these type of things are through my head all the ti
i just want to end it no one even cares , my conversations with my friends have been reduced to yeah nah and ok i feel so empty now i feel like whenever i find someone to talk about my sadness to i just become a burden , so i m better off keeping silent i ve been thinking of suicide but i m just scared hanging is too painful , jumping is too scary , and i got nothing to overdose on maybe one day i ll muster the courage to do it maybe i ll find a large rock and walk into the ocean with it so i drown
life is so pointless i m so fatigued or lazy and i just can t do anything , school s going really badly cause i can t get up in the morning , nothing s bringing me joy anymore , meds aren t working and how am i supposed to live a life if i can t even hold on to a job \? and idk i don t even like life in general , you just go to college , graduate , get a job and get kids or whatever sounds so fucking boring and every single thought just leads to suici
trying to fix my mistakes i am having one of the worst bouts of depression in my college career i love my field of study but haven t been going to class or doing work because of \( you know \) my depression i m very close to a few of professors and feel like i ve just disappointed them beyond reproach any advice on how to explain to them and jump back in classes \?

i said things i should not have said i had a wave of rage and irritability yesterday i initiated an argument with my so over something very stupid and minor everything seemed very hostile yesterday and i regret saying things i said no matter how true that felt at the time , i should always make an effort to keep yourself in check with loved ones , right \? i apologised this morning we seem to be good , but still a bit tense i do n't want my depression to justify my choice of words , however it seems like the only valid excuse at this point i'm feeling guilty and confused i should have just bottled it up
if i don t get on antidepressants soon i am going to die i currently just started a new job and have less than 20 to my name i get paid this friday but it s all going straight to bills luckily my insurance through my new job will help cover seeing a therapist and psychiatrist \( which i ve never done before ! \) but i just can t see myself lasting another 3 weeks i dropped a box at work today and broke down in tears it didn t even break
how do i feel better \? my entire life is crashing down and idk what to do there are options but i do n't like them and while they are still better than killing myself , day by day , i'm becoming more interested in commiting suici
i read my suicide letter and i got angry with how shitty it was from the grammar to the word choice to the little amount i said i hate every aspect of that letter i feel like i really did n't say enough of my feelings about everyone and everything i feel like i just half assed it i'm so angry with the little effort it seemed like i put into it i also just hate how i said everything it was so cringy , i hope when the time comes i write something at least okay

dealing with major depressive does anyone have any suggestions for dealing with major depressive \? i m 20 years old and i ve had depression since i was around 13 everyday is a challenge and i m at the point in which i feel like i m losing myself my closest friends live in different countries and i m emotionally exhausted from holding onto all of my problems without talking about them i feel like life would be easier to give up rather than fighting constantly with myself , but my family would be distraught over me hurting myself and they ve done a lot for me so i m resorting to telling people on the internet in the hope that someone knows how to deal with dark thoughts and the lack of emotions that i don t feel anymore cereal

my family does n't validate or accept my feelings , so i do n't either over the years , i 've been called lazy for wanting to lie in bed , a baby for breaking down and crying , and selfish for wanting any time to myself when they suspected that i was doing bad things to myself , i was also told that i would burn in hell for it i was diagnosed with depression , and even the doctor did n't really seem to care so i guess i do n't either i do n't take care of myself as much as i should because i'm losing my will to change to be better i'm starting to think that i really am just as useless as my family thinks i a

just got prescribed prozac could i still have small moderate quantities of alcohol \? hi , i was just prescribed prozac today and i wondering if i could still drink smoke while on it i m in college and enjoy a drink every once in a while , as well as getting drunk sometimes smoking at parties \( though not as often as i used to \) i understand that depression meds intensify the effects of alcohol marijuana if i were to have smaller doses than i usually consume \( i e limiting myself to one drink at all times \) would that be a problem , or should i avoid other substances altogether \? thank you \)

i self harmed i ve been doing it for the past couple weeks i have such a low pain tolerance so all i use is scissors never enough to actually kill myself but enough to hurt i guess i do it because it helps me cope with my depression but i just realized now how terrible what i ve been doing is this is the only place i can share and get this secret off my chest
too much pressure i ve had depression since my early teens i ve only recently started to some what cope with it , but it s starting to get worse due to feeling so much pressure for me i m not gonna get too in depth but i basically have to get my shit together and not only take care of my self but also my mother it s seems so hopeless tho , every time i think about it it feels like i m never gonna have enough to provide for myself and my family i m looking to learn to program but even then i feel like i ll never have enough to not only make sure i get the help i need but also get my family help
not sure who else needs this , but you 've made it through another day of existing i know how hard it is to be here sometimes , especially when the medicines that you 're supposed to use are n't helping as much as you 'd like them to , or the people around you do n't seem to know how much you 're struggling internally if you 've made it this far into your day , though , or even if it 's the middle of the night , and you just hopped online to scroll through reddit , i just want to congratulate you no matter what happened today , good job getting through it i'm proud of everyone here \)
hey i m really sad and i don t have anyone to talk to and i don t know what to say but my chest hurts so much and i really can t stop thinking about killing myself but i don t want to hurt my family i really want to though i take medication and i really want to swallow everything i have idk i feel dumb but i just don t know where to say this and i have nobody that really cares to listen at all
good day so i definitely have my demons that i fight everyday , i have anxiety and depression and i also think i'm bipolar but today today i'm happy to be alive that 's all that matters right now and it feels so damn good ! i know i 'll have many more bad days but if i can remember this feeling i 'll be ok to everyone , hold onto the little things , they 're what matt
trying alcohol for first time on wellbutrin \? honestly , i m really sick of not being able to try alcohol i want to have a drink or two , but i m scared of what might happen i have a group of friends that obviously will be looking after me but still i m on 300 mg a day and i really don t plan on drinking weekly or anything maybe a drink or two once a month any word of advice \?

im gonna die and no one is gonna care i'm probably going to die by suicide and no one is going to notice or care the main thing that prevents me from actually killing my self is i do n't want to be even more of a burden , i do n't want someone to haft to clean up my body but im not sure how much longer this is going to stop 
welp i never really had a normal friendship or a girlfriend , had it good sometimes with family mostly bad though , since i was always the fuck up didn t experience a lot it sucks that i m gonna miss out on all that i hate to admit that i m depressed and lonely , i always denied it or tried to pay attention to something else but it was always underlying , and i would focus back on the emptiness i guess i m letting it consume

i am my illness i am become nothing but my mental illness i hate and disgust myself on every level if i could erase myself then it would be to the net benefit to the lives of those around me , but i know that my death would deeply traumatise my kids etc i feel so trapped just want to remove myself from life entirely feel this way all the time to one degree or another , so very intensely right now though \( do n't reply , esp to say comforting nothings , i just need to say it somewhere \)
fear and pain are working both ways for me right now i fear the next 30 40 years in pain and alone i fear death itself , one way into oblivion never to exist or know i existed not knowing i was once alive not having a thought never to return forever i fear messing it up and living the rest of my life in a worse physical state on top of my emotional pain no matter how bad it gets the first fear may drive me to want to die but the second and third might keep me alive till it 's times turn to take

maybe i'm better off dead i 've sunk so low into darkness and depression , to the point that i do n't even think i can be saved , i tried therapy two times but they dont understand me and they do n't understand the agony i feel everyday the only positive thing from therapy that i got diagnosed by professionals so my family ca n't manipulate me into thinking that i'm okay and i'm faking it i'm 22 years old now and i 've spent the majority of my life in extreme levels of depression and anxiety and it did a horrible damage on everything in my life i do n't feel passion for anything anymore and i do n't have any kind of hope for the future it is logical that i will eventually kill myself before i get to 25 years old that 's my destiny

how to stop feeling like you do n't deserve a partner \? i have social anxiety , so it 's hard enough to approach somebody , but the last thing to go through my mind before i 've talked myself up is , nobody has shown interest in you there 's probably something wrong with you you do n't really deserve a partner anyway they 're probably too good for you i feel like i'm valuable and loved around my friends and family and i feel like i can stand up for myself around people i know but when it comes to strangers in public i feel like a burden and unworthy of fun social interaction how can i get over these irrational feelings \?

getting help i wish depression would be treated just like any other illness like if people would treat depression the way they treat a broken bone or a ruptured appendix i would have no problem asking for help it 's the fact that my depression has made me feel like less of a human being that 's preventing me from getting help agh this sucks

idk anymore idk if its like this for anybody else but every time i am alone i'm just thinking idk about what , but most of the time its about how good my friends and my family 's life would be without me idk why but when i see people i just fake smile and go along with whatever is happening and from the inside i feel empty every time i see people happy with friends i just get sad and feel lonely and wishing i could have that idk if its just a problem with my head or something else but probaly almost nobody is going to see or care about that
i cant properly function im inside almost all day with the corona outbreak and my mood is going down i cant think straight , gaming just makes me frustrated literally what am i supposed to do to keep afloat cant go to the gym if i even wanted to go it s just getting by here and eventually kill myself
living is becoming impossible everything is so damn hard now with this isolation thing being around people makes me forget about my pain for a while , but now i'm stuck in my 4 walls having to deal with it it was always easier for me to just go for a walk , looking at other people being happy gives me a weird sense of comfort but now , i just feel so bad again awful
out of things to try i am now looking in to clinical trials as a last ditch effort fuck you for ruining my life depression
i keep catching myself fantasizing about death it 's weirdly comforting imagining different ways i could get out , even though i'm probably not going to follow through on any scenario like i can pretend to have a little control over my fat
my therapist finally convinced me to start getting out of the house and this shit happens i'm never going to get better why the fuck should i even try
how do i keep moving forward \? living life everyday has become unbearable i hate going to sleep and i hate waking up and i hate every minute in between how do i help myself \? how do i convince myself that life has value \? please help 
first post here so i m currently struggling with the loss of my gran who brought me up since the age of five she took me in after my mum died and she passed on saturday , it s absolutely heart breaking as mother s day , my mums death date and then this happened so close together i m scared i m not going to be able to bring myself out of the way i am feeling at the moment depression is something i have suffered with since the age of 12 and i am now 21 i don t think i ll ever feel like the same person again
this quarantine fucked me in so many ways i just feel hopeless , i was only getting up from my bed to see 3 friends of mine in school , and i don t can t handle this shit anymore , i just realized they don t care , they just stay near me because they feel sorry for me being this way , i just don t want to keep moving on , i just want to be someone else , like why am i like this , just a fucking horrible person that everyone feels sorry , i just want to be truly happy again i just can t remember the last time i was truly happy , i don t even know why am i still alive , maybe i should just end it already
i think the hardest thing with depression is that it 's impossible to see a future as all i see is black 
i finally realised that i have to kill myself i am lost lost in my thoughts lost in my life i cant do anything just sit and drink beer i am trying to do sth productive but i cant i cant concentrate my mind is fucking with me i want to live normal life or be dead , but i tried so many things to create my life better that i would rather be dea
finding it impossible to cry i feel like crying would do me a world of good but i haven t been able to cry for as long as i remember i m basically numb inside and feel very little emotion from anything any advice \?
i m killing myself this evening i don t know why i m posting this here because i m afraid of people telling me that i m selfish when i already know i am or that it gets better when i already know that that isn t true i am in indescribable pain and i commend everybody in this subreddit who can keep going day in and day out while feeling the type of pain that i m feeling , but i m weak and i can t do it anymore i ve tried absolutely everything i could before resorting to this , but now it s time for me to finally help myself for good i m so sorry
depressed and can t do anything to change i m such a fucking disaster , why the fuck am i so behind in life \? i m 18 and i ve done fucking nothing with my life i m useless no matter what i have to do to improve my situation i can t do it i regularly think about su i shouldn t even be on this planet
i have a constant feeling of hopelessness looming over my head i have no hobbies anymore except for reading , because i am able to stop thinking while i read school was keeping me alive , but now it s all online until at least april 20th i feel completely undesirable and lonely i am so starved for affection and feel disgusting because i know nobody will ever love me again i have no desire to pursue something that will require work because i just don t care anymore i have two friends but they barely ever talk to me and i just feel hopeless i feel like there s no reason to be here right now sorry for the vent
i'm always here if you need to talk to me i 've always hate it when people say this , i know they are trying to be helpful but the thing i hate so much about is when you actually try to tell them you just get the same response all the time awe that 's sad or you 'll get there , trust me the only people am able to talk to about depression are also depressed because they know exactly what is is like to always be in this mind state all the ti
is apathy a symptom of depression \? i have extreme apathy about school and work i don t really care about doing good in school i m afraid it could be due to something worse like schizophrenia , but i also overthink everything , and i m kind of a hypochondriac about my mental health is this normal \?
why the fuck do i just keep on crying i m sat here now writing this with tears in my eyes and i don t know what to do i have no friends all i do is talk to random people play on my pc and that s it i don t do anything good whenever i come out of my shell i get shot down i can t be arsed i have an alcoholic dad who i wouldn t care is he died and he wouldn t care if and if i do die no one would attually care and people would not notice their then my family

suicidal thoughts i hate it when people call suicide selfish it 's not selfish to want to end your pain if you want to disappear people do n't get to feel disappointed sad , yes angry , not really i got backer acted for a suicide plan and all my aunt said to me was i'm very disappointed i said the hospital helped me but only because i wanted to go home i still cry every night and think i'm better off dead the hospital only scared me it 's like suicide is an issue that needs to be solved but if you do n't keep it a secret the police get call

help me help i ve made some progress on my depression over the last couple years , but i ve hit something of a stalemate i recently heard on a podcast that helping others with depression could help me progress so , i m looking for some mutual benefits from helping someone \( s \) who is \( are \) having trouble i d prefer to find people who are in my area since getting out is a big part of curing the disease , but i m also more than willing to chat with folks online if there aren t people here , what are the best ways places to find them \? i live in a southwest chicago suburb
spiraling out of control my entire world is crumpling at my feet my bf of 3 1 2 years decided we should break up today , my heart is shattered and now i'm about to be homeless i do n't know what to do , where to go , i have no one in my life i can even talk to i have never felt more alon
vent stream of whatever almost 2am depressed af do n't want to go to bed if i go to bed , the thoughts will eat me sitting here reading some sylvia plath it 's a clich , yeah 'you 're depressed and you read plath \? but at least i feel like plath gets it , you know \? she gets the void , the absolute nothingness , the horror of the blank ceiling looking at the wall opposite me and fighting the urge to just bang my head against it until my brains fall out , like squidward banging his head against the register in spongebob tomorrow be better though \? i hop
constantly stuck between acknowledging my emotions , validating them and letting them go on my own asking for help and talking them through with someone i don t want to burden other people with my feelings i m terrified that if i reach out to people they will absorb my sorrow or be annoyed by me being needy sometimes processing my own emotions just isn t enough and i need the attention and nurturing of someone specific then i go on over analyzing what this means about my own mental health and obvious codependency how do you be emotional without being overwhelming \?

the worst part is that these feelings are genuinely the consequence of my own actions i got myself here , and this is my punishment all of the crippling shame , the anxiety , the regrets , all of it is because i made dumb fucking decisions they say that depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain maybe that s true for some but not for me i got myself here through my own choices the worst part is this realization just makes me feel even more worthless knowing that i could have avoided the path that lead me here but then i think even deeper no matter the circumstances , i would have made shitty decisions , because my decisions are the result of my own shitty charact

i find it kind of funny seeing people freak out about having no contact with others now the corona is here the way i live my everyday life is apparently a reason for people to freak out i haven t had anyone touch me in months and now i hear people whine about not being able to touch or hug eachother or hang out with their friends anymore for a few weeks it makes me sad that being touch deprived has become normal for me but i find things that are sad funny because of coping mechanisms , so i guess it makes me laugh
i finally took a shower in like 12 days !

anyone know of any good \( and ok paying \) jobs to work from home my depression anxiety has gotten so bad these past few years i honestly think this might be my only option now i wanna start working again \( last job i had was 2 years ago \) but the last job i worked , i felt so horrible , and anxiety ridden i actually would drink before showing up , and it helped alot but then before i knew it the days where i 'd show up sober was outweighed by my drunk ones , and id go home feeling even more depressed sorry for the story , i have n't been sleeping right , and i kinda wanted to get this off my chest i just want to work , and be happy doin' something not killing insi

i feel empty i don t know what my trigger is my head suddenly makes me feel worthless and the next minute , i feel completely dark and empty thoughts running through my head and then it just stops it has that calming effect , does that mean that i have accepted that maybe being depressed brings me comfort and i m used to it \? when i feel like this , i usually go for self harm i scratch my skin until it bleeds and it will recover while it itches and pains me even if i had a good conversation with a friend , after that conversation i would in a snap of a finger get into emptiness feeling am i alone \?
i'm considering suicide there 's something bothering me , something that 's very difficult to talk about i'm trying to reason with myself , and maybe consider going to therapy , but it 's hard it feels like suicide is the best option

is depression warping my brain or am i just unlovable \? my logical side tells me it didn t work out because our attachments styles are different i m anxious and need constant reassurance he s avoidant and that need for constant reassurance pushed him away i believed when he said he loved me the illogical side of me \( or maybe it s depression talking \) tells me he never loved me that he wouldn t commit because he was waiting for someone better to come along and just told me what i wanted to hear that i m ugly and worthless and he will find someone miles better for him than me and laugh behind my back for being gullible i am at the point where i genuinely don t know what to believe any

they might be drowning too the one big reason that i have n't shared my current state with anyone is because i am very sure that they all have their own battles if this infects them , i 'll never be able to forgive myself also , there is no going back from that , which is a level of vulnerability , that is just beyond me \( i have n't bothered with a throwaway account this time \)

does depression anxiety influence love \? i have been in a relationship for 5 years , it was all fine but i always question everything sometimes i think i am too picky and the behaviors i find hurting are just normal and i should toughen up we have started long distance , and now after 3 years are again but i do n't miss him , i feel guilty about it , but i also have always been a loner \( not lonely though \) i ca n't understand if i have fallen out of love or if my mindset and thoughts work against it when i'm with him i'm fine and happy , but nevertheless , i remain confused did something similar happen to you \?

looking for advice my girlfriend of several months deals with anxiety and depression and as of lately she has been very distant and detached emotionally from me i try to motivate her and be positive but she just dismisses me and emotionally attacks me and brings me down and i don t know what to do i really care about her but she constantly is down and has started to impact me emotionally and bring my emotions down to a dark place as well if anyone has been in a similar situation before could you please give me some insight or advice please \? thanks
overworking to fight depression i'm a blue collar kid keeping myself busy keeps me sane when i feel myself slipping , i throw myself into an overtime schedule wake up a 4 am , day job until 2 30 , personal trainer at 3 or 4 depending on the day , boxing for 2 3 hours , some contract work on the side if i 've booked it in bes by 9 30 and do it all over again go 100 every day 100 of the time that works well , until it does n't soon the body starts to break down and the emotional dip is compounded by the feeling of overwork but 99 is not an option and resting is downright blasphemous because then i 'd dip again is this what an addiction feels like \?
self destruction though i have been questioning myself whether i am just acting that i am depressed or that i actually have something going on , i was wondering if anyone else has been self destructive during his her depressive phase \? i deleted hundreds of poems , burnt some of my high school memories and deleted some melodies i did on guitar i truly hate myself , and i do n't want to exist anymore people thought i was a prodigy at an early age , now i am nothing more than a piece of garbage does anyone else have that issue \?
i'm not okay i found out \( through the grapevine \) that i'm the problem they 're talking about in the meetings it 's probably true i just wish they would just bring the issue to me directly i do n't want to suck , it just happens so i'm angry , i think , but i'm not sure if it 's at then or at me also , i'm fixing my golf swing and i just keep sucking in every direction on that at least i could work my fucked up swing so i'm frustrated because i ca n't seem to make my body do what my brain knows it should le sigh
my ex who still talks to me lives 1000 miles away ive became really sad recently my ex goes to school 1000 miles away and i really like her she started talking to me again recently but not really anywhere close to how much we used to talk anyways i dont really have any friends to do anything with right now and i m becoming so lonely it hurts in my heart i used to never cry but every night i go to sleep balling my eyes out over how badly i want to be with the person i truely love anyone have any advice on what i could do \? my heart is aching and nothing i do keeps my mind off how much i want to spend time with the person i miss the most
nothing the worst thing about depression is that it takes away my ability to have the proper emotional response to certain situations like right now i know i should feel stressed and anxious about my upcoming exams but i feel nothing complete emptiness and that should make make me sad but again i feel nothing i just brush my shoulders and continue thinking about how fucked i a
my life feels ruined i 've been depressed about never having friends i can relate to because i end up doing toxic shit with anyone who ever tries to be my friend and basically ive never been able to see that im to blame in all my struggles and ive ruined my relationship with my father and brother and friends and my self esteem is and has been so low that i almost feel like i cant go on anymore but at the same time , being aware of how my behavior has affected other people and my own life might help me to rebuild myself but it feels like a gargantuan task that i dont have enough energy to do like im somwhere between hope and despair and i dont know
come on , i dont really know , but i needed to write this down i need someone , someone to hug me hold me tight and never let go ill feel real again , ill exist again im barely getting by , and none of my current relationships dont seem to matter much to the other member im regularly ignored turned down whenever i try to spark a conversation , but i cant help but use the dullest openers i wish i was an interesting individual thinking about it , i wish i was 11 again , particularly this one walk through a hilly forest , phone in pocket , listening to come on eileen out loud it makes me feel free glad to know i was named after that song , yet i yearn for someone to truly make me feel like eileen
hate being away from home so this is something i want to kinda figure out i have been dealing with a lot of stress with a relative who is in the hospital and stuff with work since she has been gone for two weeks i have had to maintain her animals and her disabled roommate and its coming to a point while staying at her house i have been missing home a lot i go there from time to time to get stuff and everytime i am there i feeling like just not leaving i just want some advice to get though this and be able to feel home sick so much
i f ing hate myself so much i m just so ugly , unattractive , and unskilled there s absolutely nothing there to be interested in just a miserable shell of a human being and the shell is broken , too i m so ugly i get now why know girl has said yes i get now why people don t initiate anything with me i get now why i don t deserve anything that i have i m so fat and ugly , and i don t have anything worth loving nothing to make someone love this empty shell i live in , this cracked , broken , disgusting shell i wonder how anyone even bears to look at me , much less have the bravery and courage to send anything more than a middle finger my way gosh i hate myself so much
isnt life just the greatest \? i just managed to make myself feel so bad that i became physically sick and had to throw up twice , at 2am , and then take like half an hour to clean the mess up i'm disgusted by myself and honestly dont know what 's wrong with me that i do this to myself why is emotional self harm the one i'm into \? why do i enjoy making myself feel as bad as i can until my body ca n't take it anymore \? i'm so pathetic
i m here to talk hi i have suffered from depression many times and every time i found talking to someone helps they don t necessarily have to suggest anything to help my depression , just having someone to listen to me helps so if anyone wants to chat give me a shout
anxiety i have major anxiety and im also bi yesterday i told my crush all these late night thoughts i have and told me to come here so these late night thoughts just tell me how i am a burden i guess
when will it be over i do n't even have the energy to say everything i just want it to be over i ca n't take it anymore there is no one no one who is helpful and i fucking hate swallowing pills every morning and my therapist seems tired of my shit and my professors need to get their heads out of their asses here 's to probably retaking 3 more classes unless i die before then which i hope i do ha ha
you can t help me my depression has been kicking my ass for the past few months and recently it s been destroying me i m having bad episodes becoming so sad that i feel physically sick blaming myself for everything that isn t going well i don t know what to do and everytime i feel like i know what to do i feel stupid for thinking it your words can t help me only i can help me and i can t help myself right now
in a pit i m trying to dig myself out of this hole but i keep making it worse i recently went on vacation to my favourite place , i was hoping this trip would reset me and make me feel better it didn t the whole time i was sad , being distracted i keep feeling that there s something wrong with me i mean i was in a beautiful country , surrounded by people who love me instead i was miserable , dreading it and not feeling one ounce of love i don t know what to do to get better it feels like i ll feel this way forever i can t stop crying from how miserable i am from how my life is
it makes me so angry seeing people use their depression to get attention on social media especially being someone who has received absolutely zero support and empathy from the people around me i don t even want anyone to feel sorry for me i just want people understand i m hurting and i m trying the best i can to get by instead my family turns around and talks shit about me , and makes me feel worse than i already am i ve been dealing with mental health issues since i was 10 years old , exacerbated by the fact i was abused for much of my childhood they turned a blind eye to it all
everything is boring and pointless and nothing interests me before we start i am a 27 year old male struggling to live day to day because of extreme boredom and general apathy i could probably go on but lets see what happens i know i sounds testy and i am honestly i but this mindset has been getting too much recently and i keep wanting to see if i am just missing something or i am just pretty much screwed until i muster up the balls to end it i am sorry for wasting the time of whomever may read this
what are the things depression hasn t stolen from you yet \? i want to die and i m willing to give up everything i can count on one hand the things that still give me positive emotions i love the mountains hiking in them and especially driving on the fast highways through them with all the steep grades it s beautiful and takes focus to put the least amount of stress on the engine and breaks it gets me outside of myself , which is practically impossible otherwise unfortunately i don t live near the mountains and am lucky if i get a chance to go \(
anybody ever make realizations about yourself , then hate yourself for how you act for example i constantly fear missing out over stuff my friends are doing and then feeling abandoned and nobody likes me , etc , then acting mean to them passive aggressively or something then i spot that im being selfish and it isnt their fault at all even though it feels like the end of the world for me and all im doing is just hurting other people and making other people not like me and that just makes me hate myself even more for how selfish and self centered i am i feel like my heads splitting apart cause whatever i do or think about it leads to me hating myself even more and feeling like a piece of shit person
