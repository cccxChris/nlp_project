pangs of loneliness and purposelessness i had a lot of fun the past two days it felt really nice to hang out with friends and really just remembering how close of a friends we are how can it be , that i feel so lonely , purposeless and empty now \? out of the blue lately i 've been realizing how much my life will change today , i logged my expenses and income of the past five months i figured out how big of a student loan i'm gonna take out i responded to some dorm listings studied for a bit i thought , what if i fail out of my study program \? if i do n't make any friends and just do nothing all day \? am i gonna waste my life , that 's already insignificant \? i do n't know
deciding about my future is so fucking difficult i should chose a university i want to study at and apply there in 2 months everyone around me knows what he wants to do in the future , they have some hobbys , things they like doing i do n't have such thing it 's just that nothing is enjoyable for me , everyday is suffering , i ca n't find any motivation even to learn , i'm barely passing my year and now i'm supposed to find something i 'd want to do for the rest of my life and study it for 4 or more years like , i want to be dead , there 's nothing i 'd want to do , i'm so tired of doing things
sunday sunday s are the worst i always sleep in and feel like a failure for wasting the day and i always plan to do housework so my week starts better than the last but never get the motivation to do it i m in a bad place today and i think my friends are sick of trying to pull me out of it so thought i d let it out on here instea
i keep flashing back to my suicide attempt , do you \? sometimes it 's because i'm nervous about something and my immediate thought would be you 'll fail at this too , you could n't even hang yourself correctly you failure sometimes it 'll be because i saw or heard something that made the memories jump to my mind and other times it 's because i 'll consciously force myself to remember it , i guess to remind myself i should be miserable do any of you guy have to deal with this as well \? repost because i need answers
my world is falling apart i m so scared i don t know where to turn my husband is losing his job , and i m unemployed we won t be able to pay for food , shelter , or health insurance we re both diabetic i m on a very expensive antidepressant my young son has adhd we all take meds i feel like there s no way out for any of us i don t know how to fix this
i never feel good enough i hate looking towards social media for validation in real life i hate myself it makes me feel like i am only valued by my likes or when i post good content i made a short film called rehab at 16 on youtube detailing my experience at the hospital after a suicide attempt and i am fixated on the reception it 's getting and nothing else right now it 's the only thing i am clinging to to make me feel good i truly feel like i have lost all ability to truly connect with people i'm just so fucking done with this why cant i connect \?
by focusing on depression , you will never conquer it i think that depressed people are very intelligent and it s a viscous cycle by focusing on the negative we seem to have this duty to fix anything wrong and when it s too hard to pinpoint we go haywire and it destroys our psyche just let go it s hard i m hard on myself a lot but if i forget about it by a change of scene then i forget but i can go right back and say nothing works tldr just kill the cycle by stop dwelling in it i even think you should stop following this type of r it s going to feed doom into your mind again just try to break the cycle smash it into pieces
who else is having a massive flare up \? i take my meds most days , and i have a supportive spouse i have bad days sometimes , maybe once a month or less i have bad moments more frequently , mood swings , what have you , maybe a few a week but i have n't had a flare up like this in years no pleasure in anything , listlessly drifting from one thing to the next , but nothing brings me joy not suicidal , at least , but feeling like it 's all a bit pointless
dump it s almost been a year since and i m still not fully detached from it i hate it it s consumes me some days other days i m far away but today it s with me and it feel like nothings changed but so much has
might kill myself in a few hours might not i feel like i should be dead , but i do n't really want to die i just want to end the suffering which is gettibg worse every day that passes i ca n't find the motivation to live any more , but , still here i a
theres literally no point to life i get flash episodes of this as part of my depression when i'm driving doing my job like i'm passing by streets , cars , people , and everything seems so pointless why am i doing that job why is that person walking there why is that car parked there why why why why all these people at the supermarket buying shit i just walk by the checkouts and it 's different people but all doing the same shit packing and paying walking out wtf is the point \? if we all died in a mass extinction event no one would know if we did n't arrive after the dinosaurs no one would ever have known they existed and even when we do know they existed like so what \? still zero point to anything
i usually post negative stuff here so for a change i stopped writing and i think it really negatively impacted my headspace so i started a blog , solely for myself and for the first time in a while , i m having fun writing again depression can t take that from me , even though it has tried its absolute hardest even if my writing is crap , even if no one ever reads it , who cares \? creating it makes me happy
i do n't know how to stop being sad i 've tried pretty much everything so far have actively been trying for years now i 've made some gross mistakes in the middle i'm still in treatment i'm going to keep trying , not giving up yet , hell no but do n't you ever have this feeling of fucks sake , how much more do i need to do to try to feel better \? why is shit not working \? i do n't know man i'm just so ti
i ca n't sleep without accepting this hard truth so i punish myself everyday at night so i can atleast get a good sleep it 's not my past mistakes or failure , it 's not my parents or neighborhood it 's me i'm the problem i'm the reason for my own sadness and emptiness no matter what happens in my life , i 'll never change it 's just who i'm that 's the hard truth
sometimes it hits hard i do my best to never to never complain , but thought i would give this a try i ve had this deep depression , lately a little bit of regret , nostalgia , loneliness , and too much time to think i retired from the military , last november as much as i was looking forward to it , i miss it everyday mainly the comradeship the knowing that although the day is stressful , it s stressful along side your brothers and sisters moved to a new place , with just my dog my kids are adults , but i miss them everyday and the loneliness i m pretty sure that takes the cake the time i spend staring out an apartment window not much to say , other than my sporadic thoughts maybe i just needed it off my chest
why even bother to do anything that makes you happy \? you always feel 10x worse after it 's over maybe it 's because deep down you know the feeling is n't coming back for the next three weeks you go through all this effort , just to feel happy for what \? like a day \? if that and then whatever you were happy over ends or you stop liking it like every other interest or hobby that was massacred by the murderer called depression it seems pointless people always tell you to go out and find something you enjoy , but when you 're depressed , with actual depression , it 's not going to last it never does why even bother \?
1 thing to live for yeah i only have one thing to live for and it 's this girl i like after about a month of realizing that i actually loved this girl she attempted suicide fortunately it was an attempt and she did not succeed when she i learnt that she tried to kill herself my mental state went rock bottom i thought of every single way possible to kill myself and wondered who it would affect and that i did n't give a shit about it anyways this has all happened in the time lapse of a week and i needed to write it down somewhere last thing to note and that is fuck lif

i'm not sad anymore just painfully numb , everything seems so dull and dreary i wake up in the morning and already start wishing the day would end so i could go back to sleep i get so bored i start hurting myself to feel something other than just nothing , but i dont feel that either and despite all that i do n't think i have depression or any mental illness , i used to think so since i was sad the whole time and hated everything and everyone , but now nothings there i want to go back to those miserable times cause misery seems better than nothing at all

practice notes does anyone else write practice fake suicide notes just to see what your final words would be as if you were going to kill yourself right after but then you just throw it away or stash it \? or is that just me \? if i'm being honest im sort of expecting that after one of my fake notes , then its gonna end up being the real deal and i will not have said everything i wanted to say or explained things the way i wish i could tbh i dont even know if i would want to leave a note for that reason but also there are things that people dont know that i would like to tell them if it was the en

i went to get help again i finally got an appointment with a doctor and nurses they were the nicest ones i 've met so far they took me seriously and were active in finding appropriate help for me the doctor told me nice things to calm me down , she gave me a prescription for new medication , made sure i could afford it , sent requests to see a therapist and a psychiatrist closeby and gave me another appointment in 3 weeks it 's far from what i got last year i'm glad i went to this new place i'm completely drained from this and still feel worthless , but now i know someone reliable has my back and takes my mental health seriously
