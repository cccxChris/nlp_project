physician , psychologist , or psychiatrist first steps at getting help where do i start \? i know i m depressed , but who do i talk to about it first \? i m supposed to get a physical soon , so should i bring it up to my physician \? i feel uncomfortable just thinking about bringing it up , like how do i even make begin that conversation \? will they refer me to a psychologist psychiatrist based on what they think is best \? cause i sure don t i don t know if i need to be medicated i just need this pain to go away
my mom is terribly sad and its making me anxious im axious i dont want anything im really sad i have art work to do and the only thing i want to do is cry to sleep all day long all of this because my sister is an idiot that cant understand that my dad manipulate her do you have any tips to distract myself from this its been 4 days and it feels like and eternity i dont want to dig again it hurt to much
1 1 20 i m really really hurting today the holidays were extra rough this year and really reminded me how alone and unlovable i am then new years was just the cherry on top with all the cute couples and people who have accomplished a lot in the last year i felt a kind of sadness and heaviness last night amp today that i haven t felt in years just feel like everything i want in life is so out of reach

i thought things would change somehow but they have n't yet my dad died recently and it was one of a few weights off my conscience , he battled alcoholism most of his life and he meant well in the end in spite of it people tell me he is at peace now , and i do n't need to worry anymore i do n't really feel as burdened as i did before , not as tense but i still feel like things are unresolved , not with my dad , but with life overall like i do n't know what to do with myself , outside of trying to find work and a forming a stable romantic relationship

it s just another 365 days to keep moving a year is only 365 days , it goes by like that without you even noticing it time does not stop and it only goes by faster as you get older i hereby will stop wasting my time dwelling and overthinking , i m not getting any younger our lives are merely a manifestation of our mind , if you want it badly enough i believe you can have it your life is what you focus on , if you focus on negativity that s all you will see learn to be grateful for what you have no matter how small , and take steps to get what you want cheers to a more productive and enlightening 2020

guess what look you depressed , people , i live a sad life and my life sucks , but you do n't see me complain about it , what makes me mas about the subreddit is that i see some depressed people get mad over people trying to help them in my opinion you are the biggest dicks that ever existed in reddit

why don t people do anything when they know you re not well \? do you have to self harm or attempt suicide before people in your life actually take notice and help \? if i saw someone who behaved the way that i do at worst i d think he needs help and i will try to help at best i d think he s a kindred spirit and we could be buddies what does it take for people to realise that you re not just saying his shit it s really how you feel and each day it continues you get closer to giving up if ya know what i mean
i have a good porpuse for this year this year when i 'll think about cut myself or suicide or something bad i 'll go do something different and stop thinking like that , i said myself that my girlfriend needs a recompense fro helping me things year , so i 'll do it trying to pass depression thanks all the people here that helped me and good luck for this 2020 guys
whoever is going through something or is sad angry heartbroken at the moment , rant under this post let it all out it s good for you ! i m here for you x
changing your perspective success here 's a quote that is all too true and hopefully will help shift your perspective of one from failure to success in these simple tasks to laugh often and much to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends to appreciate beauty , to find the best in others to leave the world a bit better , whether by a healthy child , a garden patch , or a redeemed social condition to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived this is to have succeeded ralph waldo emerson
i just want to be at peace with myself

introduction to me here 19 male in tampa , florida , my name is lucas recently been pretty depressed and also have hashimotos thyroid autoimmune disease just wanna say that a solution to depression can be supplements and diet , allot of times it 's not just something you can talk yourself out of , almost physical or chemical vitamin adk with fatty meal used to take a b complex used to also take magnesium citrate life is short and confusing for us who have depression decide if you wanna climb out of the depression with experimenting with psychedelics , exercise , etc i am very confused as to what i should do with myself but no one can experiment for you this whole thread also kinda encourages depression by reading about it but i do like to read these posts
